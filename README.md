# TDD with UNO

This is a remake of a personal UNO console game I developed 1 year ago, now using TDD (test driven development) in order to improve the game by validating its mechanics with the aid of unit tests and a more structured approach while developing it.  
Considering my previous -- and incomplete -- project suffered from a few bugs, I believe the lack of tests could have been one of the causes for it.  
I've been reading Kent Beck's "Test Driven Development By Example" as a way to learn more about TDD and since then I've decided to tackle this old project of mine to apply this approach that can improve my testing, as well as developing, skills.  

Feedback is appreciated!
